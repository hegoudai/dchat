# dchat
A decentralized multiplatform chat software using ECDH to transfer message.

## Usage
### 1. Find a server
You have to find a dchat-server shared by others or deploy your own dchat-server,
What you really need to get is an ip address or a host, like this: 47.106.144.145

### 2. Share your URI 
After configuring your server in dchat-client app, you will get an uri like this: dc://hegoudai@47.106.144.145/BN7-lwTfMw09OVweh2-o2LjBAQaO9WinnTmlg1XE3kO8,
share it and wait some talking to you.

### 3. Start chat
Start a new chat by using the uri you get from somewhere, every message is encrypted, so feel free to talk!
